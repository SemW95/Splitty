## START (15 min)
- **Opening by chair (1 min)**
    - We are starting well on time.
- **Check -in: How is everyone doing? (2 min)**
    - Everyone is in a good mood and ready for this meeting
- **Announcements by the team (2 min)**
    - On closing branches after merge request; since we're working according to the principle
    - that general issues should be split into many small issues, a branch should never remain after being merged ocne
    - therefore a merge request should go alongside the closing/pruning of the branch that  deviates from main.
- **Summary of last weeks sprint (3 min)**
    - Everything is well discussed and concerns for dependencies on other people to be done we're well-communicated
    - in Whatsapp. Certain classes require additional testing
- **Approval of the agenda - Does anyone have any additions? (1 min)**
- Noone has additions for now.
- **Approval of last minutes - Did everyone read the minutes from the previous meeting? (1 min)**
    - Last weeks notes we're well-received and the remarks by the TA we're
- **Announcements by the TA (2 min)**
- The TA stresses the importance of having a correct name and email set up for git commits.

- **Presentation of the current app to TA (3 min)**
    - Rens volunteers to demonstrate understanding of the current status of the class structure.
    - Later we decide that everyone should speak for their own piece of code since they are most familiar with it.
    - Events has constructors that need to be fixed
    - merge

## Talking Points (22 min)
- **Talking Points: (Inform/ brainstorm/ decision-making/ discuss)**

    - <Agenda -Schema> Schema (7 min)
        - We are going to use an H2 database
        - We'll be Implementing via JPA, which means each object/class will have it's own relation in our database
        - We will aim to set up our database with JPA within this sprint.
        - During the friday meeting we will make big strides for the database.
        - This was chosen since we require having learnt about it in the lecture which is on Wednesday
    - <Agenda -UX-Skeleton> UX Skeleton (7 min)
        - For this sprint we will have the UX document initialised.
        - We have decided to distribute the load over Rens and Eva, with other members tuning in order to learn
        - The full Deadline is in two weeks but an informal deadline for the bare minimum is this sprint (this week)
        - We should have the UX before we start working
        - We are using the Landscape orientation.
        - Validation of IBAN BIC etc is done both in the front- and backend (commons)
        - Controller backend
    - NEXT WEEK: (time constraints)
    - <Agenda -Basic-Implementation> Basic Implementation (8 min)
        - What features/classes need to be flashed out?
        - Currency is a difficult subject, what to do?


**NOTE: anything that was skipped or unclear will be discussed in detail after the TA meeting.**


## Wrapping Up (8 min)
- **Summarize action points: Who , what , when? (5 min)**
    -  we will not use gitlabs features for estimating how much time it takes to implement an issue
    -  the assignee is the person who works on the code
    -  two people will be the reviewers, we communicate who still needs to merge for the weekly knockout criteria
    -  that person will merge the request itself
    -  we should simply work on ux, proper estimates on when a deadline should be can only be agreed upon after the sprint
    - today and the lecture tomorrow
    - the code of conduct is uploaded by the rens
    -
    - Lukas will be head, Xiaoyu will be minute taker next time
    - The discussed rule of two reviewers will not be reflected in formal rules on gitlab, but a mutual respect towards the
    - rule.
- **Any Questions? (2 min)**
    - next week feedback round.
- **Closure (1 min)**
